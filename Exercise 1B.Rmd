## Sampling 100 values from a log-normal distribution (mu = 1, sigma = 0.25)

sample <- rlnorm(100,1,0.25)

## Creating a histogram of the distribution and the distribution on the log scale 

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
hist(sample, main="Histogram of distribution",xlab="Sample",xlim=c(0.5,6),col="darkgrey")
hist(log(sample), main="Histogram of distribution on log scale",xlab="Log(Sample)",xlim=c(0,2),col="darkgrey")

```

```{r}

## Mean and variance of the sample:
## The mean is calculated with mean(sample) whereas the variance is calculated with var(sample)

## The mean of the sample is 2.80
## The variance of the sample is 0.45
